# base65536
Reimplementation of [ferno][1]'s [`base65536`][2] in C for UNIXoid shells. 

## Why
 * Why not?
 * beat [Twitter][3] and pack your tweet with 280 characters!
 * Annoy your friends!

## Building
To generate the binary, run `make`.    
If you want long options (e.g. --decode), enable `-DLONG_OPT`. 
To automatically run the included tests, run `make test`. (will rebuild)    
You can copy the resulting `base65536` file to a directory in your `$PATH`.

## Usage
`base65536` uses GNU's [`base64`][4] tool as a reference and therefore has the
same command line arguments. This means, you can either pipe data in or give a
file as an argument. 

### 'Hello World'-Example:

    echo -n "Hello World" | ./base65536

will output:
